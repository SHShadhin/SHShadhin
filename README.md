🌱 I’m a beginner web developer who is currently learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
I enjoy building simple projects, practicing every day, and improving step by step.

💻 Right now, I’m focused on:

Understanding web fundamentals

Creating small front-end projects

Writing clean and simple code

Learning through practice and mistakes

🚀 My goal is to become a skilled web developer by continuously learning and building real projects.
